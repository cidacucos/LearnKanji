1,日,Day,"Sun, Day, Japan","This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun.

14,人,Person,Human Being,"The character for enter (Frame 842) showed someone walking inwards (in terms of the direction of writing), the one for person, shown here, represents someone walking outwards.","As a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form ⺅ (Similar to イ).<div>The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of person so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use person for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular person. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.</div>","Behold Mister T (of ""A-Team"" fame)!

18,口,Mouth,Mouth,"Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for mouth is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle.","As a primitive, this form also means mouth.

The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.",A month is longer than a day.,"Am I the only one who sees this as someone sticking their ass in the air ""mooning"" someone (two cheeks of the butt and the legs coming off of it)? The Moon meaning connects well to the meaning of month, considering that months were traditionally measured by the phases of the moon.

Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.","To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a fireplace (or hearth) or a raging conflagration like a forest fire for this kanji's primitive meaning.
